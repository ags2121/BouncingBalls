BouncingBalls
=============

Simple mod that adds collision detection to Cay Horstmann's bouncing ball animation. Spawns a new thread whenever a ball is created. Would like to add more sophisticated physics. You can download the GUI at: http://alexsilvamusic.com/java/bouncingballs/bouncingballs.jnlp
